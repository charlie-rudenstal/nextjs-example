# Next.js + GraphQL with Apollo

This project aims to be a minimal example of using Next.js together will Apollo Client and Apollo Server.
It displays a list of users with playlists and supports creating new users.

## How to run

```bash
$ (cd frontend && yarn build && yarn start)
$ (cd users && yarn start)
```

This will build a bundle for production. For just trying this out it will be quicker to follow the instructions for developing locally instead.

## How to develop locally

```bash
$ (cd frontend && yarn dev)
$ (cd users && yarn dev)
```
